"Hi there!

I've been working on a simple calculator project, and before you dive into the code, here are a few things to know:
1. I added a cool animated calculator icon from lordicorn.com.
2. The entire code for the calculator is in the script file and pops up over the lord-icon. 
  It's done by some styling magicâ€”starting with 'display: none' and then switching to 'display: block' after a 2-second delay.
3. To handle the input (which is always a string), I used the 'eval()' method. I know, 
  it has its security risks, but for a small project like this, it does the job. You could also try using the Function constructor as an alternative method.
4. Be aware of a glitch when dealing with expressions like "0012+0013-001442" due to leading zeros. If you've got a solution of this problem, please let me know!


Thanks!"
